# Two fields separated by space.
# First field is the sha-1 of the this repository at the time of the fork
# Second field is the forked child repository and @sha-1 at the time the child was forked from the parent repository
# The second field may contain an @directory after the @sha-1. That @directory is the subdirectory within the child repository where the fork was put.
# These branches would have had the same contents in both repositories as at these two sha-1s.
# If branch names exist in the repositories, they may be used instead of sha-1s
# These fields must be url encoded so that they contain no spaces within each field
# There is a file in each child repository called .fork which contains the same information, but in the opposite order.
# There may be more than one child repository forked from this repo. That is allowed.
